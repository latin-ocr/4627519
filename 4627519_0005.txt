This reei of microfiim contains materiei
which hes peper color changes steinS, or
illustrations (some of which may eppeer on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure thet eii text end iiiustretions ere
ieqibie‚ exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore, when text enci illustrations exist
in e sinqie imeqe or when materiei
becquounds differ, such tremes mey need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure refiects trie camere
operator’s best effort to capture the majority
of tite text; the second exposure refiects the

cernere operator’s best effert to capture
iliustretive materiei or the remaining text. it

is hoped thet this practice wiii resuit in e
microfiirn product thet fuiiy serves the needs

ot most reseerchers.
